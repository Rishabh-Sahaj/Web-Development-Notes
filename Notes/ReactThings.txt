1. ( <input type="text" name="name" value="Joe"/> ) in Html has set initial value of value attr. to 'Joe' and its after values as user's input as rendered on screen. But ( <input type="text" name="name" value="Joe"/> ) as jsx in react has set initial value of value attr. to 'Joe' and makes input element on screen uneditable / untypable, i.e, value of value attr. is not going to change. I did this in html as well as in react component and found out this difference.
[may be because in html the element is handeled by html DOM whereas in react it is handeled by virtual DOM ]
[the native behaviour of the input, to update its value on typing, is overridden by React here. ( URL - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34006333/cant-type-in-react-input-text-field ) ]
[SEE HtmlDOM-Things.txt ALSO]

2. I think in React the attributes we write in opening tag of an element in jsx are not actually attributes but are properties . Thus value prop on input element is value property of input element object not value attribute.

3. Link and navlink are the ones because of which default refresh of the page can be stopped
