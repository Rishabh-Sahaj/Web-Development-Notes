for that you have to understand how webpack works, basically all the javascript in all the files is compiled into a single file and then is inserted into the html file in the public folder as a script tag.(actually webpack dev server creates a new temporary folder "build", which is not saved to disk and is only kept in memory, and places the html and javascript files there). also all the css files are compiled into a single css file and that file is then put inside the build folder. so the path to the background image in the css file is relative to that build folder, because your css file will be finally put inside that folder. All these things are mentioned inside the webpack configuration file which tells webpack how to treat each file type. if you use "create-react-app" , you can't see these config files as they are hidden somewhere inside, so you have to "eject" out of the "create-react-app" and then you are on your own, you can edit webpack config files and change its behavior.

you can also create the final "build" folder in the disk, to deploy it to a server, by using: "npm build".  
"npm eject" , "npm start" and "npm build" are scripts inside the package.json file, they are basically keys inside a javascript object which refers to the actual commands. when you do "npm start" , you are actually doing the command: "react-scripts start", which in turn is doing:"webpack-dev-server" which tells webpack to start the build process, create a local server and serve those files from that local server. it also has "hot reloading" which means that you don't have to refresh the page if you make any changes in your code
