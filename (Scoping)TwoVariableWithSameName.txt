 //You can't have two variables with the same name within the same scope and access both, the latter will overwrite the former, so they should have different names.

 var a = 0; // global
function doStuff() {
    var a = 10; // local
    alert(a);
    alert(window.a)
    function() {
        var a = 20; // even more local
        alert(a);
        alert(window.a);
    }();
}
alert(a);
doStuff();
alert(a);

//The variable 'a' outside of the function can be accessed, as any variable not declared in a non-global scope (declared in global scope) is placed inside the window object. You cannot access the value of a inside the doStuff function. You can still access the global variable using window.a.
